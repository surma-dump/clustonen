What still has to be implemented:

Well, basically everything, but here are the things which came to mind:

- Transfer of required modules via direct connection, not other protocols.
- Write basic modules (Protocolsupport, Clientinformation,...)
- Mapping of Clients to IP
- Maybe write an own LibArgtabe? For performance and dependecie struggle reasons?
