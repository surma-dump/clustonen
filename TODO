What still has to be implemented:
- Move existing code in lib/ and include/ to new comment style
  (see commit b61e53d82a81163f8156613a615b19d554435339 for an example)
- Check if destructors are thread safe
- Take a closer look on the socket class. I experienced mysterious
  disconnects from time to time
- Notify other threads when a client gets deleted.
- Make the network name configurable via a configfile parameter

Well, basically everything, but here are the things which came to mind:

- Transfer of required modules via direct connection, not other protocols.
- Write basic modules (Protocolsupport, Clientinformation,...)
- Maybe write an own LibArgtabe? For performance and dependecie struggle reasons?
